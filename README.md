# Tech Jobs Academy logos

Various logos for [Tech Jobs Academy](techjobsacademy.com).

## Styles

Two styles currently exist:
* `logo-tja-lg-*` — square "TJA" logo
* `logo-tja2-lg-*` — landscape "Tech Jobs Academy" logo

## Formats

Two file types currently exist in this repository:
* `.psd` — Adobe PhotoShop sources files
* `.png` — rasterized files

No other file formats have been created, as they don't gain us anything (e.g. JPEG is both larger in file size and loses transparency).

## Sizes

Only one size is currently committed:
* `logo-tja-lg-*` — 960 x 960 px
* `logo-tja2-lg-*` — 3660 x 990 px
 * these have a 15px buffer on all sides to allow for more graceful scaling

To create new sizes:
* open the appropriate `.psd` and export with the dimensions you want, OR:
* downscale / upscale the rasterized `.png` files in this repo

## Colors

Three colors are used in these files:
* #000000 (black)
* #FFFFFF (white)
* #1DB0ED (blue)

### Transparency

Some of the rasterized logos forego an explicit background color in favor of transparency (those with `tx` in the filename).

When possible, it's advisable to use the logos with transparency to achieve best color matching.

## Suggested uses

The rasterized `.png` files in this repo are generally fine for websites, printing, etc.

You might want to:
* export smaller images for optimizing load times on websites (depending on display size)
* export larger images for printing in high quality (e.g. a large banner)
 * note that it may be best to send the print shop a `.psd` source file and let them export as they see fit
